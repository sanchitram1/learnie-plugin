# Learnie: Enhance Your Learning with Active Recall and Spaced Repetition

## Introduction

Learnie is an Obsidian plugin designed to help students and lifelong learners remember and learn more effectively. By incorporating contemporary learning techniques like active recall and spaced repetition, Learnie transforms your Obsidian vault into a powerful learning tool.

## Key Features

### 1. Convert Files to Notes for Tracking

Easily convert any file into a note by typing the command "Convert to note". This process updates the frontmatter of the file to include a unique note ID and links to additional resources.

### 2. Track Changes with the Diff View

Each tracked note is assigned an ID and includes links to view the differences between the current note and the last modified version. This feature allows you to see what has changed in your notes over time, helping you keep track of your revisions and edits effortlessly.

### 3. Create and Review Questions

Create review questions directly within your notes. Select text to automatically use it as an answer, streamlining the question creation process. This feature uses the flashcard strategy and helps you prepare for exams by regularly reviewing the questions you've created.

### 4. Daily Review

View all notes that were changed in a day, facilitating regular review sessions and helping you stay on top of your learning material.

### 5. Review Marking

Mark note revisions as reviewed to keep track of your progress and ensure no changes slip through the cracks.
